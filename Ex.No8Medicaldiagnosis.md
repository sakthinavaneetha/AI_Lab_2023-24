# Ex.No: 8  Logic Programming â€“  Medical Diagnosis Expert System
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
Write a Prolog program to build a medical Diagnosis Expert System.
###  Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Write the rules for each diseases.
3. If patient have mumps then symptoms are fever and swollen glands.
4. If patient have cough, sneeze and running nose then disease is measles.
5. if patient have symptoms headache ,sneezing ,sore_throat, runny_nose and  chills then disease is common cold.
6. Define rules for all disease.
7. Call the predicates and Collect the symptoms of Patient and give the hypothesis of disease.
        

### Program:

```  
        # Initial values of Alpha and Beta
MAX, MIN = 1000, -1000
 
# Returns optimal value for current player
#(Initially called for root and maximizer)
def minimax(depth, nodeIndex, maximizingPlayer,
            values, alpha, beta):
  
    # Terminating condition. i.e
    # leaf node is reached
    if depth == 3:
        return values[nodeIndex]
 
    if maximizingPlayer:
        best = MIN
 
        # Recur for left and right children
        for i in range(0, 2):
             
            val = minimax(depth + 1, nodeIndex * 2 + i,
                          False, values, alpha, beta)
            best = max(best, val)
            alpha = max(alpha, best)
 
            # Alpha Beta Pruning
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
          
        return best
      
    else:
        best = MAX
 
        # Recur for left and
        # right children
        for i in range(0, 2):
          
            val = minimax(depth + 1, nodeIndex * 2 + i,
                            True, values, alpha, beta)
            best = min(best, val)
            beta = min(beta, best)
 
            # Alpha Beta Pruning
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
          
        return best
      
values = [3, 5, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0, -1] 
print("The optimal value is :", minimax(0, 0, True, values,MIN,MAX))
```

### Result:
Thus the simple medical diagnosis system was built sucessfully.
